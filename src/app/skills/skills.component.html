          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>I have experience in JavaScript(ES6), TypeScript, Angular, HTML5 & CSS3 and am always keen to learn more technologies. I speak English, Spanish, Swedish and Finnish and have several years of experience working in tourism and as an Account Manager which has provided me with the skills to manage a team, negotiate and analyse data. I had my first taste of coding at university, where I discovered how powerful and useful it is and it is for this reason that I would like to pursue it as a career.
