            My love of beautiful websites and curiosity made me discover and explore Web development which naturally, led to my great interest in front-end web development. Now, I'm devoted to building quality and beautiful websites & apps. Some of the technologies I've worked with are HTML & CSS, JavaScript (ES6+) and Angular.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have experience in JavaScript(ES6), Angular, HTML5 & CSS3 and am always keen to learn more technologies. I speak English, Spanish, Swedish and Finnish and have several years of experience working in tourism and as an Account Manager which has provided me with the skills to manage a team, negotiate and analyse data. I had my first taste of coding at university, where I discovered how powerful and useful it is and it is for this reason that I would like to pursue it as a career.</p>
